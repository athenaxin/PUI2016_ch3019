# Citibike mini project review by fb55

## IDEA: 
Ok, its simple enough. 

## Null hypothesis formulated fine in equations, but "The Mean of citibike trips start in the rush hours( 7-9 am and 4-6 pm ) is the same or smaller than the mean of the rest of citibike trips." Does not mean anything in English. I think what you want to measure is the MEAN NUMBEr OR CITIBIKE TRIPS THAT START... In addition you may also want to state what the mean is over: a month? includes weed days and weekend days? cause rush hours do not apply, or are not the same on weekends.

## data wrangling

the data wrangling phase seems ok but it is far from finished. the absolute number of trips is meaningless unless you devide by the nuber of hours in the "rush hour" and "non rush hour" intervals. then you have to verage over the days and choose what to average on, and how to use the weekends. 

choose a descriptive variable name, not data. 


Once you are done with the data wrangling a test of means (t-test for example) is appropriate.
