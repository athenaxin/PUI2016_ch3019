### Assignment 2

I worked with Yuxuan Han and we discussed about how to read the academic papers effectively. We also worked together to identify the independent, dependent, and control variables from the two academic papers. The markdown file for original table is [here](https://github.com/nnhoucheng/PUI2016_ch3019/blob/master/HW4_ch3019/HW4_2_ch3019.md).
