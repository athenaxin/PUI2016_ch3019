### Assignment 1

My partner is Reid Kelsey (NetID: kdr276, GitHub username: kdr276). Thanks a lot for his help! My review markdown file in his GitHub repository is [here](https://github.com/kdr276/PUI2016_kdr276/blob/master/HW3_kdr276/CitibikeReview_ch3019.md). The review markdown file in my GitHub repository is [here](https://github.com/nnhoucheng/PUI2016_ch3019/blob/master/HW4_ch3019/CitibikeReview_ch3019.md). The markdown file may look uncomfortable online since Github can not show some `LaTeX` marks. But it works normally in Jupyter ipython notebook markdown cell.

### Assignment 2

I worked with Yuxuan Han and we discussed about how to read the academic papers effectively. We also worked together to identify the independent, dependent, and control variables from the two academic papers. The markdown file for original table is [here](https://github.com/nnhoucheng/PUI2016_ch3019/blob/master/HW4_ch3019/HW4_2_ch3019.md).
